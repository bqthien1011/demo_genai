### Open Questions

- How are the AI-generated images sourced (static files, API, etc.)?
  - Currently using static files to illustrate the workflow. Later, after the API is ready, it will be integrated.
- What triggers the prompt from the chatbot (specific conditions)?
  - When the user chooses "agree" when the Robot chatbot asks "If no suitable product is found, you can let Gen AI create a custom sample for you!"
- Should there be a way to revert back to regular suggestions?
  - Yes, there should be a way to revert.
